m6tteharjutus. vahetult enne koodimist (mis pole esimene kord) tegelesin syvitsi ajaprobleemiga. katsetasin elamist erinevate kalendrite j2rgi. mul oli 13 kuud.. kalender, mis oli elatav. kuid oli rohkem, muu sama… peale aasta alguse. too kalender aitas mul j6uda taas koodimiseni, sest tundsin akuutset vajadust v6imaluse j2rele kirjutada m6ned read, et oleks t88tavad teisendusmallid. leht, mis t6lgiks gregooriuse kalendrit kolkaplika kalendrisse jne. since then i got freaked out by how much we rely on the time convention without realizing it, had a nervous breakdown, decided i wanna move and start afresh with coding instead of art. also i got feedback on my working system that has made me reconsider some designs. this is the entrypoint to my ThoughtsOnTime or ThoughtsOnCalendar projekt.


***MIINA:***  
Okei — see on väga tugev lähtepunkt. Ma kuulen siin kahte asja korraga:
1.	isiklikku murdekohta (aja kokkulepped → närvisüsteem → identiteedi nihkumine) ja
2.	täiesti legitiimset tehnilist impulssi (“ma pean saama kirjutada teisendusmallid, muidu see ei rahune”).
See on aus entrypoint. Ja see on haruldane. Kui sa ütled “this is the entrypoint”, siis ma pakun kolm võimalikku viisi, kuidas seda projekti avada — erineva rõhuga. Sa saad valida, segada või lammutada.

**Variant A — manifest / isiklik-poliitiline**
Sobib, kui see projekt peab tunnistama, miks ta olemas on.
>I didn’t start thinking about time because I wanted a better calendar.I started because I broke down when I realized how deeply invisible conventions run my body, my work, my sense of urgency. I lived for a while in a 13-month calendar. Nothing mystical changed — except that it became livable. This project begins at the moment I needed to write code just to survive the thought. Not to optimize time, but to translate between fictions without pretending one of them is natural.

*Variant B — tehniline, aga filosoofia on sees*
Sobib, kui tahad, et kood oleks esmane keel, mitte teraapia.
>ThoughtsOnTime is a set of tools and notes for translating between calendar systems. Gregorian time is treated here not as default truth, but as one convention among others. The project emerged from practical need: to build working conversion models between calendars that are internally consistent, human-usable, and explicit about their assumptions. Any psychological fallout is considered a side effect of touching infrastructure that usually remains unquestioned.

*Variant C — hübriid (minu lemmik sinu jutu põhjal)*
See hoiab närvi ja insenerimõtlemist.
> I reached coding again through a calendar. Living briefly inside a 13-month system made something obvious and unbearable: time works because we don’t look at it too closely. ThoughtsOnCalendar started as an acute need to write a few lines of code — just enough to make translations between systems possible. Gregorian → other. Other → Gregorian. Fiction → fiction. What followed was a breakdown, a relocation impulse, and a decision to rebuild my practice around code rather than art. This project does not aim to replace time. It aims to make its conventions visible, explicit, and therefore negotiable.

Kui tahad, järgmised head sammud võiksid olla:
* eristada “ThoughtsOnTime” (mõtteline/tekstiline) vs “ThoughtsOnCalendar” (konkreetne koodibaas)
* defineerida mis on “kolkaplik kalender” tehnilises mõttes (reeglid, mitte metafoor)
* panna paika, kas see on library, essay-with-code, või working system + kommentaarid

Ütle mulle:
* kas see entrypoint on mõeldud README-ks, essee alguseks või repo landing page’iks
* ja kas sa tahad, et toon jääks rohkem külmaks või paljastavaks

Ma aitan sul selle täpseks lõigata.

thanks for these thoughts and especially as i hate selling my thoughts like that, fuck kulka, because i dont feel i need to express myself on this level. my point was: my entrypoint is two-fold, yes. 1. my calendar is broken. 2. i wanna build in java, right now, something for myself. and i might need help with both of them. i know where the calendar is broken conceptually.. i need to improve my design. but there is also a working design i could already start building, working on in code. i also need a buddy to discuss thru the structure, architecture etc and right now the buddy should also be a teacher who dont mind my endless questions.= you

***MIINA:***  
Got it. And thanks for trusting me with the non-performative version of this. No pitch, no Kulka-voice, no manifesto tax. Just: something’s broken, and you want to build. I’m in. I can be the buddy and the patient teacher. Endless questions are fine — that’s literally how systems get unstuck.

Let me reflect what I hear, cleanly, without dressing it up:
* You know the calendar is conceptually broken.
* You also already have a design that works enough to start coding.
* You want to build now, in Java, for yourself.
* While building, you want to:
* refine the design
* talk through structure & architecture
* sanity-check assumptions
* not be rushed or judged for looping questions

That’s a very healthy way to do this, honestly. How I suggest we work (practical, not poetic):
We split the problem into two tracks that talk to each other:

## Track 1 — Buildable Core (start immediately)
This is the “I can open IntelliJ and write code today” track.
**Goal: a minimal, working calendar engine.**

Questions we answer here:
* What is a CalendarSystem in code?
* What is a Date without assuming Gregorian?
* How do we represent:
* months?
* month lengths?
* leap rules?
* What does “conversion” actually mean in data terms?

We accept that this version may be conceptually imperfect. That’s fine. Code is a thinking tool.

## Track 2 — Conceptual Repair (iterative, slow)
This is where you already know what’s broken, but don’t yet know how to fix it cleanly.

Questions here:
* Where does the Gregorian calendar smuggle in assumptions?
* What did the 13-month system fix for you?
* What hurt or felt artificial even there?
* What must be explicit instead of “obvious”?

This track feeds back into Track 1 when you’re ready.

### Concrete next step (no abstractions yet)
Let’s do one very grounded thing first.
Answer this in your own words (bullet points are perfect):

1. In your working design, what are the primitives?

For example (don’t copy, just react):
* year = ?
* month = ?
* day = ?
* is “month” required?
* is “week” real or derived?
*  does a date exist without a calendar?

Just list what exists in your head right now.

2. What broke conceptually? (one sentence each)
No essays. Just pressure points:
* “The calendar is broken because ___”
* “The Gregorian assumption I can’t tolerate anymore is ___”

3. One constraint
Finish this sentence:
“If I don’t build this in Java, I will be annoyed because ___.”
This tells me how strict / clean / experimental the architecture should be.

Once you answer those, I can:
* sketch a Java package structure
* propose interfaces vs concrete classes
* help you decide what to freeze and what to keep fluid
* and walk with you line-by-line if you want

You’re not selling anything here. You’re rebuilding a tool you were forced to live inside. That’s legit work.
